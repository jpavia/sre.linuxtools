#  Revision History:
#
#                                 Updated file to accept all parameters that as useable by checkStatus to provide additional messaging
#        Jeff Pavia  7-10-2011    Added quotes to check status calls so that spaces would work in description and test case parameters
#

# Check parameters

   echo "Usage: `basename $0`  <command> [test case number] [test case description] [neg]"  # basename will return "checkStatus"
